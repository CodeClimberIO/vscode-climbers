[Code Climbers][codeclimbers] is Dedicated to developers who want to learn and share how they git gud at their craft ðŸ¦¾. This is a VSCode Extension that report time to the Code Climbers CLI 

## Installation

1. Press `F1` or `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` and type `install`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extension`.

   ![type install](./images/type-install.png)

2. Type `code climbers` and hit `enter`.
 
3. Enter your [api key][api key], then press `enter`.

   > (If youâ€™re not prompted, press `F1` or `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` then type `Code Climbers API Key`.)

4. Use VSCode normally and your coding activity will be displayed on your [Code Climbers dashboard](http://local.codeclimbers.io)

## Usage

Visit [http://local.codeclimbers.io](http://local.codeclimbers.io) to see your coding activity.

## Tech

Code Climbers uses the incredible work done by Alan Hamlet and the WakaTime team!

## Configuring

VS Code specific settings are available from `âŒ˜ + Shift + P`, then typing `code climbers`.

For example, to hide today's coding activity in your status bar:

Press `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` then set `Code Climbers: Status Bar Coding Activity` to `false`.

Extension settings are stored in the INI file at `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg`.

More information can be found from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli configs].

If using an online IDE like [gitpods](https://gitpod.io/), add your [api key][api key] to global ENV key `CODE_CLIMBERS_API_KEY`.

Notes:

1. `$HOME` defaults to `$HOME`
1. To disable the extension at startup add `disabled=true` to your config, this operation can also be performed by pressing `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` and selecting `Code Climbers: Disable`.

## Troubleshooting

First, turn on debug mode:

1. Press `F1` or `âŒ˜ + Shift + P`
2. Type `> Code Climbers: Debug`, and press `Enter`.
3. Select `true`, then press `Enter`.

Next, open your Developer Console to view logs and errors:

`Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools`

Errors outside the scope of vscode-codeclimbers go to `$HOME/.wakatime/wakatime.log` from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli help].

If your error message contains "won't send heartbeat due to backoff" then delete your `~/.wakatime/wakatime-internal.cfg` file to trigger an API connection so we can see the real error message.

The [How to Debug Plugins][how to debug] guide shows how to check when coding activity was last received from your editor using the [Plugins Status Page][plugins status page].


For more general troubleshooting info, see the [wakatime-cli Troubleshooting Section][wakatime-cli help].

### SSH configuration

If you're connected to a remote host using the [ssh extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) you might want to force WakaTime to run locally instead on the server. This configuration is needed when the server you connect is shared among other people. Please follow [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_advanced-forcing-an-extension-to-run-locally-remotely) guide.

## Uninstalling

1. Click the Extensions sidebar item in VS Code.

2. Type `code climbers` and hit enter.

3. Click the settings icon next to Code Climbers, then click Uninstall.

4. Delete the `~/.wakatime*` files in your home directory, unless youâ€™re still using Code Climbers with another IDE.
